Cytarabine therapy is rarely complicated by cardiotoxicity. The present report describes the clinical course of a 35-year-old female patient with acute myelogenous leukemia in complete remission, who developed sinus bradycardia while on high dose cytarabine as a consolidation therapy. The electrocardiographic findings suggested that bradycardia was most probably the result of sinoatrial blockade. The available information regarding a possible association of cytarabine with disturbances of cardiac rhythm is reviewed.
The present study investigates the effects of hypothyroidism on both the redox state and the thyroid hormone receptors expression in the heart ventricle of virgin and pregnant rats.Hypothyroid state was induced by 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil in drinking water given to Wistar rats starting 8 days before mating until day 21 of pregnancy or for 30 days in virgin rats. Serum paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity, serum and heart nitrites, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were analyzed. Heart protein oxidation, as carbonyls, and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) activities, were determined. In addition, heart expressions of NADPH oxidase (NOX-2), CAT, SOD, GPx, and thyroid receptors (TRα and TRβ) mRNA were assessed by RT-PCR. Inducible and endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS and eNOS) were determined by Western blot. Hypothyroidism in the heart of virgin rats decreased TRα and TRβ expressions, and induced oxidative stress, leading to a decrease of nitrites and an increase of carbonyls, NOX-2 mRNA, and GPx activity. A decreased PON-1 activity suggested low protection against oxidative stress in blood circulation. Pregnancy reduced TRα and TRβ mRNA expressions and induced oxidative stress by increasing nitrite and TBARS levels, SOD and CAT activities and NOX-2, eNOS and iNOS expressions, while hypothyroidism, emphasized the decreases of TRα mRNA levels and did not alter the redox state in the heart. TR expressions and redox balance of rat hearts depend on the physiological state. Pregnancy per se seems to protect the heart against oxidative stress induced by hypothyroidism.

The overexpression of metallothionein-2A (MT-2A) is frequently observed in invasive human breast tumors and has been linked with more aggressive breast cancers. MT-2A overexpression led to the induction of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migratory and invasive abilities. The reduction of MT-2A expression through small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MT-2A in invasive MDA-MB-231 cells completely inhibited both cell invasion and migration. In addition, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and the transcriptional activity of AP-1 and NF-κB were upregulated by MT-2A overexpression. Collectively, our results provide the first demonstration that MT-2A promotes breast cancer cell invasion by upregulating MMP-9 via AP-1 and NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we found that MT-2A silencing can inhibit breast cancer invasiveness.
The effects of 3, 15, and 27 months of treatment with nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/day) and enalapril (5 to 20 mg/day) on diastolic blood pressure (DBP), overnight urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were studied prospectively in a parallel group design in 13 microalbuminuric non-insulin dependent diabetic patients with mild hypertension and biopsy-proven diabetic glomerulopathy. Throughout the study period DBP decreased in both groups to < 95 mm Hg. At three months UAE, GFR, and RPF did not change significantly. At 15 and 27 months UAE (microgram/min, geometric mean and 95% C.I.) decreased respectively from 47.4 (23.4 to 95.9) to 28.6 (10.3 to 79.4), and to 22.3 (10.9 to 45.2; P = 0.0005) with nitrendipine, and from 58.3 (30.3 to 110.9) to 44.1 (22.9 to 84.8), and to 14.7 (4.4 to 49.3; P = 0.0025) with enalapril. Four patients in each group were normoalbuminuric at 27 months and none became macroalbuminuric. At 15 months the GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2, mean +/- SD) increased from 69.5 +/- 15.2 to 96.6 +/- 22.0 (P < 0.05) with nitrendipine and from 58.9 +/- 10.7 to 78.5 +/- 11.0 (P < 0.05) with enalapril. At 27 months the GFR was still numerically higher that at baseline either with nitrandipine (81.2 +/- 7.8) and with enalapril (79.9 +/- 17.7) (P = 0.7). The RPF (ml/min/1.73 m2, mean +/- SD) at baseline and at 27 months was comparable either with nitrendipine (456.6 +/- 165.3 vs. 400.9 +/- 112.9) and with enalapril (400.3 +/- 81.3 vs. 399.0 +/- 123.7). Both treatments were well tolerated. This is the first evidence that long-term effective control of arterial blood pressure by a calcium channel blocker or by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in addition to reducing albuminuria, also improves GFR in incipient nephropathy.
Lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in plasma generally reflect complex influences of multiple genetic loci. Even an autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity, as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels vary widely within the same pedigree. Molecular screening for LDL receptor ( LDLR) mutations among 75 patients with clinically apparent FH led to identification of a novel splice-site mutation (IVS14+1 G>A) shared by 14 patients. Genealogical research confirmed that all 14 carriers were part of the same 1135-member pedigree with a common ancestor. The mutation resulted in an abruptly truncated LDLR protein, reducing functional LDLR activity by half in heterozygous carriers of the mutant allele. Of the 208 members of the kindred who were screened for the presence of this LDLR mutation, we identified 94 carriers and 114 noncarriers. Nine principal apolipoprotein genes that might affect LDL cholesterol differentially according to LDL-receptor status were examined in this pedigree. Strikingly lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol values were observed among the majority of the LDLR mutation carriers who were simultaneously homozygous for the -265C variant of apoA-II (total cholesterol: 324 +/- 8 vs 244 +/- 19 mg/dl, P = 0.0015; LDL-cholesterol: 237 +/- 8 vs 155 +/- 18 mg/dl, P = 0.0008). In vitro transfection assays showed that transcriptional activity of the apoA-II promoter was reduced by 30% in the -265C variant as compared with the -265T variant. We thus concluded that one variant of the apoA-II gene was associated with reduced plasma LDL cholesterol only in FH patients.
Defibrotide is an antithrombotic drug which enhances prostacyclin production and activates fibrinolytic system. The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement of walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication treated with defibrotide. DICLIS was a double blind, placebo-controlled study which included patients with walking distance autonomy at a standardized treadmill test < or =350 > or =100 meters. A total of 310 patients were randomly allocated to placebo (n = 101), defibrotide 800 mg/day (n = 104) or defibrotide 1200 mg/day (n = 105). During a one year follow-up, the Absolute Walking Distance (AWD) was measured six times (0, 30, 60, 90, 180, 360 days). Similar improvement in walking distance was found in the three groups until the 90th day; thereafter placebo group showed no further increase, while AWD continued to increase in the defibrotide groups. Between the 180th and 360th day visits, AWD was significantly higher (P <0.01) in patients given defibrotide than in patients given placebo. No difference in efficacy was observed between the two dosages of defibrotide. No differences in side effects were observed among the three groups. The results of the present trial suggest that long-term administration of defibrotide improves walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication.
Since co-administration of ezetimibe, a specific inhibitor of cholesterol absorption into the intestine, has been shown to augment lipid-lowering effects of statins, ezetimibe plus statins is a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients. Statins have been shown to ameliorate renal function and reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, effects of co-administration of ezetimibe with statins on renal damage and dysfunction in CKD patients remain unknown. In this study, we examined whether co-administration of ezetimibe with pitavastatin could augment renoprotective properties of pitavastatin in non-diabetic CKD patients with dyslipidemia. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels were reduced more by co-administration of ezetimibe (10mg/day) with pitavastatin (2mg/day) (n=10) than by pitavastatin alone (n=10). In addition, ezetimibe plus pitavastatin treatment produced significant incremental reduction in proteinuria related to pitavastatin therapy alone. In univariate analyses, proteinuria was correlated with plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol (inversely), asymmetric dimethylarginine, an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and urinary excretion levels of L-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), a marker of tubular injury and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative stress marker. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that LDL-cholesterol (p<0.001) and urinary excretion levels of L-FABP (p=0.001) and 8-OHdG (p<0.001) were independently related to proteinuria (R(2)=0.969). Our present study demonstrated for the first time that co-administration of ezetimibe enhanced proteinuria-lowering effects of pitavastatin in non-diabetic CKD patients partly via a cholesterol-independent manner. Ezetimibe may have pleiotropic actions that could contribute to renoprotective properties of this lipid-lowering agent.
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug used in renal transplantation, lupus nephritis and pemphigus vulgaris patients. An apparent link is described between the use of MMF with prednisone to treat pemphigus vulgaris and the development of red blood cell anemia. Specifically, after initiation of 500 mg MMF twice a day given in conjunction with the long-standing use of prednisone, which had been tapered to a dose of 10 mg daily, the patient's red blood cell count dropped by 17% over 7 weeks. To put this into perspective, total aplasia of red blood cells for 40 days would result in a drop of 30-33% in the red blood cell count. In the transplantation literature, MMF has been noted to lower red blood cell counts. One previous study of four transplant patients whose immediate post-transplantation immunosuppression utilized corticosteroids, cyclosporine, MMF, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin noted anemia in 13% of them. The dermatology literature heretofore has not noted that anemia is a side effect of patients taking MMF to treat pemphigus. This report suggests that anemia can occur due to MMF, in particular when it is given with prednisone, a side effect well documented in the transplantation literature when the triple combination of MMF, cyclosporine and prednisone is used. It would therefore seem prudent to monitor red and white blood cell counts in patients taking MMF. A review of the literature also reveals that MMF is a safe medication that appears to have a more favorable side effect profile than azathioprine, although it is more expensive than azathioprine.
Intrathecally (i.t.) administered ruthenium red (40, 80, 160 ng) dose-dependently inhibited formalin-induced nociceptive response. Ruthenium red caused a significant inhibition of pain-related behavioral responses induced by i.t. capsaicin but not by i.t. substance P. These results suggest that ruthenium red produces analgesia by inhibiting the release of neuropeptides in the spinal cord.
Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a predominantly recessive platelet disorder that is characterized by mild thrombocytopenia with large platelets and a paucity of α-granules; these abnormalities cause mostly moderate but in rare cases severe bleeding. We sequenced the exomes of four unrelated individuals and identified NBEAL2 as the causative gene; it has no previously known function but is a member of a gene family that is involved in granule development. Silencing of nbeal2 in zebrafish abrogated thrombocyte formation.
Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder that is characterized by large platelets that lack α-granules. Here we show that mutations in NBEAL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), which encodes a BEACH/ARM/WD40 domain protein, cause GPS and that megakaryocytes and platelets from individuals with GPS express a unique combination of NBEAL2 transcripts. Proteomic analysis of sucrose-gradient subcellular fractions of platelets indicated that NBEAL2 localizes to the dense tubular system (endoplasmic reticulum) in platelets.
Lead is a neurotoxin that affects the developing central nervous system and may potentially induce apoptotic cell death. We investigated the effect of ascorbic acid against lead-induced neurotoxicity in the developing rat hippocampus. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control group, lead-treated group and lead plus ascorbic acid-treated group. Lead (0.2% lead acetate) was administered to female rats during pregnancy and lactation, in their drinking water. During this period, rats in the lead plus ascorbic acid-treated group received 100 mg/kg/day ascorbic acid, orally. At the end of the treatment, neuronal damage, apoptosis and blood lead levels were determined and the levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were immunodetected in the hippocampus of 21-day-old male pups. Histopathological evaluation demonstrated that ascorbic acid significantly attenuates apoptosis in the developing hippocampus and also spares hippocampal CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons. Simultaneous administration of ascorbic acid and lead lowered the level of Bax protein and increased Bcl-2 in pup hippocampus and reduced lead level in blood of dams compared with lead-treated only. Based on these results, it seems that ascorbic acid may potentially be beneficial in treating lead-induced brain injury in the developing rat brain.
Next-generation RNA sequence analysis of platelets from an individual with autosomal recessive gray platelet syndrome (GPS, MIM139090) detected abnormal transcript reads, including intron retention, mapping to NBEAL2 (encoding neurobeachin-like 2). Genomic DNA sequencing confirmed mutations in NBEAL2 as the genetic cause of GPS. NBEAL2 encodes a protein containing a BEACH domain that is predicted to be involved in vesicular trafficking and may be critical for the development of platelet α-granules.
Emergence of a lamivudine (LAM)-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term LAM therapy. Entecavir (ETV) is a new drug approved for treatment of HBV infection with or without LAM-resistant mutants. This report describes an ETV-resistant strain of HBV, which emerged after prolonged ETV therapy in a patient who did not respond to LAM therapy. Direct sequence analysis of the ETV-resistant strain showed appearance of amino acid substitution rtS202G in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, together with rtL180M + M204V substitution that had developed at the emergence of LAM-resistant mutant. In vitro analysis demonstrated that the rtL180M + M204V + S202G mutant strain displayed a 200-fold and a 5-fold reduction in susceptibility to ETV compared with the wild- type and the rtL180M + M204V mutant strain, respectively. Adefovir was effective against the ETV-resistant strain both in vitro and during the clinical course. In conclusion, this study showed that virological and biochemical breakthrough due to ETV could occur in patients infected with LAM-resistant HBV and confirmed that the addition of rtS202G substitution to the rtL180M + M204V mutant strain is responsible for ETV resistance and we could treat the resistant mutant successfully.
Mutations G2370A, G2372A, G2373A, G2375A, Y3937A, S3938A, G3939A and K3940A were made in two potential ATP-binding motifs (amino acids 2370-2375 and 3937-3940) in the Ca(2+)-release channel of skeletal-muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor or RyR1). Activation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding by Ca(2+), caffeine and ATP (adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-methylene]triphosphate, AMP-PCP) was used as an assay for channel opening, since ryanodine binds only to open channels. Caffeine-sensitivity of channel opening was also assayed by caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release in HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type and mutant channels. Equilibrium [(3)H]ryanodine-binding properties and EC(50) values for Ca(2+) activation of high-affinity [(3)H]ryanodine binding were similar between wild-type RyR1 and mutants. In the presence of 1 mM AMP-PCP, Ca(2+)-activation curves were shifted to higher affinity and maximal binding was increased to a similar extent for wild-type RyR1 and mutants. ATP sensitivity of channel opening was also similar for wild-type and mutants. These observations apparently rule out sequences 2370-2375 and 3937-3940 as ATP-binding motifs. Caffeine or 4-chloro-m-cresol sensitivity, however, was decreased in mutants G2370A, G2373A and G2375A, whereas the other mutants retained normal sensitivity. Amino acids 2370-2375 lie within a sequence (amino acids 2163-2458) in which some eight RyR1 mutations have been associated with malignant hyperthermia and shown to be hypersensitive to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol activation. By contrast, mutants G2370A, G2373A and G2375A are hyposensitive to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol. Thus amino acids 2163-2458 form a regulatory domain (malignant hyperthermia regulatory domain 2) that regulates caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol sensitivity of RyR1.
Hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis were seen in three patients and additionally hypernatraemia in two patients treated with 100 mega units of sodium penicillin G for subacute bacterial endocarditis. The hypernatraemia was probably due to the administration of insufficient fluid, while urinary potassium loss was an important factor in producing hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis after. Penicillin may promote urinary potassium excretion by acting as a non-reabsorbable anion.Potassium depletion during treatment with massive doses of sodium penicillin G may be prevented by concurrently administering potassium-sparing diuretics or by using the potassium salt of penicillin.
We performed a retrospective analysis of the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcome of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in 50 children prepared for bone marrow transplantation with busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). The overall incidence of VOD was 28% (14/50). The incidence of VOD among patients transplanted for leukemia was 36% (14/39). In contrast, no patient transplanted for a genetic disease developed VOD. Neither patient age, sex, remission status, type of graft (i.e. allogeneic or autologous), past history of liver disease nor pretransplant liver function tests were associated with an increased risk of VOD. In addition, 23 of 50 patients had pretransplant samples available for antihepatitis C virus (HCV) testing; 3/23 were reactive (two of nine patients with VOD and one of 14 patients without VOD were positive for anti-HCV). We found a high incidence of pleural effusion in patients with VOD (7/14), an association that has previously not been described. VOD was manageable and resolved in all patients.
We report on the ability of a delayed sympathectomy after a prolonged hyperalgesia to result in a subsequent enhanced hyperalgesic response. Sympathectomy was performed one day after injection of prostaglandin E2 plus rolipram, which induces a prolonged sympathetically-maintained hyperalgesia [Aley K. O. and Levine J. D. (1995) Eur. J. Pharmac. 273, 107-112]. The duration of hyperalgesia produced by a subsequent injection of prostaglandin E2 or prostaglandin E2 plus rolipram was then assessed. Lumbar surgical sympathectomy, done on day 2 or 3, prevented prostaglandin E2 plus rolipram-induced prolonged hyperalgesia from developing when they were injected five days after surgery, similar to the previous report of the effect of prior sympathectomy to block the rolipram enhancement [Aley K. O. and Levine J. D. (1995) Eur. J. Pharmac. 273, 107-112]. Sympathectomy done five days after injection of prostaglandin E2 plus rolipram, however, paradoxically prolonged (at least 10 days) hyperalgesia induced by a subsequent prostaglandin E2 plus rolipram injection, a duration much greater than that seen after prostaglandin E2 plus rolipram in naive animals. To determine the roles of prostaglandin E2 and rolipram in the prolongation of hyperalgesic response after delayed sympathectomy, rats were treated with either prostaglandin E2 or rolipram prior to sympathectomy. Prostaglandin E2 or rolipram alone were also administered five days after the sympathectomy. It was found that sympathectomy done five days after first injecting either prostaglandin E2 or rolipram alone did not produce enhanced hyperalgesic response. These data suggest that induction of a prolonged state of mechanical hyperalgesia causes time-dependent alterations in the sympathetic control of peripheral nociceptive mechanisms such that sympathectomy can lead to enhanced hyperalgesic response. These findings may be relevant to post-sympathectomy pain, a clinical entity for which there has been no available animal models.
To estimate the incidence of pancytopenia in patients taking leflunomide with or without methotrexate in Australia.
Review of spontaneous reports to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC); estimation of incidence using national prescription reimbursement data; concomitant exposure to methotrexate was estimated using three sources of information.
ADRAC received 11 reports of pancytopenia (meeting predefined criteria) associated with the use of leflunomide during its first 31 months of marketing. In nine reports, the patients were also taking methotrexate. Estimates of incidence in patients taking leflunomide alone ranged from 1 in 3698 to 1 in 4582 patients exposed; for patients also taking methotrexate the estimates ranged from 1 in 575 to 1 in 822.
Use of methotrexate with leflunomide increases the risk of pancytopenia compared with use of leflunomide alone. The haematological toxicity of the combination requires further study.
The effect of dietary exposure to synthetic estrogens on hepatocarcinogenesis was evaluated. Diethylnitrosamine-initiated and 0.85% NaCl solution-treated noninitiated female Sprague-Dawley rats were transferred to semisynthetic diets containing mestranol (0, 0.1, or 0.5 ppm), ethinyl estradiol (0.5 ppm), estradiol (0.6 ppm), or mestranol plus beta-methasone (0.5 and 0.2 ppm, respectively). gamma-Glutamyl transferase (GGT)-positive transections and hematoxylin and eosin-detectable nodules and carcinomas were scored at 9 and 12 months. Quantitative stereological calculations were performed to determine GGT lesion number and size. At 9 months, in diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats, ethinyl estradiol and mestranol caused 3.5- and 4.4-fold increases, respectively, in the number of GGT lesions per liver and an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas while estradiol had no enhancing effect. Addition of beta-methasone to the mestranol-containing diet caused a significant decrease in GGT lesion number but not carcinoma incidence compared to mestranol alone. At 12 months, in diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats, mestranol caused a dose-dependent increase in GGT lesion number. The hepatocellular carcinoma incidence was significantly increased at the high mestranol dose. Small increases in the numbers of larger GGT lesions were also observed in noninitiated animals treated with mestranol and ethinyl estradiol and are most probably due to promotion of spontaneously initiated hepatocytes. These results indicated that the synthetic estrogens cause dramatic increases in the number of presumptive preneoplastic GGT lesions. Carcinoma incidence is also enhanced. Thus, these results confirm and extend our previous studies which together with the results of others have shown that synthetic estrogens can act as promoters of hepatocarcinogenesis.
All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Generally, it is well tolerated but it has some side-effects, some of which may be fatal. The most severe side-effect of ATRA is ATRA syndrome; the other side-effects are rather dermatologic. Among these vasculitis has not been reported so far. We detected fever and skin lesions in two patients treated with ATRA where histopathologic examination revealed necrotizing vasculitis. With cessation of ATRA and corticosteroid administration, the lesions healed and fever quickly disappeared.
Cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced nephrotoxicity hampers the immense therapeutic potential of such a powerful immunosuppressant. The present study was conducted with an aim to explicate the contribution of sulphated polysaccharides (SPS) in abating the lipid abnormalities induced by CsA in the rat kidney. Hyperlipidemia associated with nephrotic syndrome may play a role in the worsening of renal function. Male albino Wistar rats sorted into four groups were used for the study. CsA was given at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight, orally for 21 days. Significant alterations in the lipid profile as well an increase in the activity of cholesterol ester synthase, coupled with a decrease in cholesterol ester hydrolase and lipoprotein lipase enzyme activities were noted in the plasma and kidneys of CsA-administered rats. A marked increase in the lipoprotein fractions, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), along with a decrease in the HDL level were found in CsA-administered rats. The degree of nephrotoxicity allied with lipid discrepancies was evident from augmented urinary excretion of urea, uric acid and creatinine. Further, an enhanced susceptibility of the apo B-containing lipoproteins (LDL + VLDL) to oxidation in vitro, induced by copper ions was also found in the plasma of CsA given groups. While SPS co-treated groups (5 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) revealed a normalized lipid profile and lipid metabolizing enzymes, the supplementation of SPS also brought back the elevated urinary constituents close to that of the controls and substantially minimized the oxidative changes. With these observations, it may be concluded herein that SPS may be an ideal choice as a renoprotective and hypolipidemic agent against CsA-induced hyperlipidemic nephropathy.
Although most patients with thymoma present with a mediastinal mass amenable to surgical resection, some patients develop metastatic disease requiring systemic therapy. The majority of thymomas express somatostatin receptors as demonstrated by octreotide scanning, an observation which has prompted the clinical use of octreotide in patients with this disease. Many patients with thymoma exhibit autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes, most frequently myesthenia gravis. We report here the case of a patient with metastatic thymoma who developed a profound autoimmune polymyositis and lupus-like syndrome that flared following treatment with octreotide and was associated with a clinical response to this agent. No evidence for myesthenia gravis was discovered. The severity of the myopathy necessitated mechanical ventilation for 12 weeks. The natural history of thymoma, treatment options including recent combination chemotherapy regimens, and potential mechanisms for flaring of autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes triggered by therapy of thymoma are discussed.
Since 1971, 55 case-reports of rifampicin-induced acute renal failure (ARF) have been published. Covic et al described 60 consecutive cases of rifampicin-induced ARF during a period of eight years (1987-1995) from Iasi Dialysis Centre, Romania. The systenic data on this condition are not available, in view of the anecdotal nature of the observation from our country.
The aims of study were to analyze clinical features, course and outcome of ARF complicating rifampicin therapy at our centre.
We retrospectively studied prevalence, clinical presentations and renal histology and outcome of 11 cases (eight males, three females, aged 42-72 years) who were referred to Nephrology Unit of University Hospital, Varanasi for acute renal failure following retreatment with rifampicin between period of 1994-1999.
The gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting) and 'flu like' (fever, weakness and body ache) syndrome were the most frequent presenting features. The clinical signs of intravascular hemolysis were observed in four cases. The commonest laboratory findings included: Anaemia (7), leukocytosis (5), thrombocytopenia (3) and toxic hepatitis in (2) patients. Toxic hepatitis, hemolysis and ARF was seen in one patient in combination. The typical clinical features of allergic interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis were seen in six and two patients respectively. Renal biopsy in three cases revealed; crescentic GN (1) and ATN in (2) patients. Acute renal failure complicating rifampicin accounted for 1.8% (11/607) of all ARF cases hospitalized in our centre during the study period. Renal function returned to normal in nine cases and one patient died on account of hepatic failure (toxic hepatitis). The patients with crescentic GN remained anuric and became dialysis dependent. Thus, clinical course of rifampicin induced ARF was favourable; with only one mortality, compared to a 18% mortality rate among all ARF patients.
Acute renal failure complicating rifampicin therapy is not an uncommon condition, and typically occurs after reintroduction of rifampicin. The renal prognosis is usually favourable. Intermittent or interrupted therapy appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of acute renal failure.
