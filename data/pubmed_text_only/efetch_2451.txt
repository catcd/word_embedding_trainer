To examine the effect of carboplatin on testicular function, carboplatin was administered to mature male Sprague-Dawley rats. Four weeks after carboplatin treatment, the serum level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) significantly increased in animals treated with 30 mg kg-1 carboplatin (p < 0.02). After 8 weeks of administration, the sperm count and motility in the cauda epididymis decreased in the rats treated with 30 mg kg-1 carboplatin (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively). The percentage of a-type tubules and the diameter of seminiferous tubules were also significantly reduced in the group treated with 30 mg kg-1 carboplatin (p < 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively). The serum levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone were not changed, although the serum level of FSH increased in the animals treated with 20 and 30 mg kg-1 carboplatin (each, p < 0.005). All parameters returned to normal values 12 weeks after the treatment. In conclusion, carboplatin impairs spermatogenesis by possibly damaging the spermatogonia and Sertoli cells but does not affect the Leydig cell function.
Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is a key enzyme in azathioprine metabolism mediating both immunosuppression and cytotoxicity. TPMT activity may be influenced by a mutation in the TPMT gene resulting in individual differences in azathioprine metabolism. Individuals heterozygous for TPMT mutations or with low TPMT activity may be susceptible to azathioprine toxicity. We evaluate TPMT genotyping and TPMT enzyme activity as predictive tests for developing azathioprine-related adverse events. Neurological patients (n=129) observed whilst taking azathioprine therapy were genotyped for the TPMT*2, *3A and *3C mutations; TPMT enzyme activity was analysed in 92 of these patients. Ethnic appropriate controls (Black, Mixed-Ancestry and White) were genotyped (n=465) and of these controls TPMT activity was also measured in 115. Azathioprine-related adverse events developed in 21.7% of the patients; early (within 1 week) events included gastrointestinal symptoms (n=8/28). Haematological toxicity, hepatotoxicity, arthralgia, rashes and pancreatitis developing between 4 and 240 weeks. Genotyping showed that only four of 28 cases who developed adverse events, were heterozygous for TPMT*3A or *3C. Heterozygous patients developed either haematological or hepatic toxicity. In an ethnically heterogeneous society TPMT enzyme activity proved difficult to interpret as measurements amongst controls showed significant ethnic variation (p=1 x 10(-6)); cut-points between "low" and "normal" TPMT activity correlated with indigenous African genetic ancestry. Ethnic appropriate cut-points were determined but due to the ambiguity in interpreting TPMT enzyme results in heterogeneous societies, we favour genotyping as a predictive test. The positive predictive value of genotyping was low, but the likelihood ratio for developing either haematological or hepatotoxicity by identifying TPMT heterozygosity, was 9.75. In our patient population this translates into an improvement from a pre-test probability of developing haematological or hepatotoxicity of 11%, to a post-test level of 50%. Heterozygous patients may then be targeted for a more "tailored" increase in dosing and regular laboratory monitoring.
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, adverse effects, dosage and administration, and role in therapy of vorinostat in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) are reviewed.
Vorinostat is a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced CTCL. Its primary biochemical mechanism is to correct an aberrant balance between acetylated and deacetylated histones, the proteins involved in chromatin structure and organization. Vorinostat is metabolized and excreted following glucuronidation by the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl-transferase (UGT) enzyme system. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding for this enzyme system, UGT1A1, may be an important predictor of vorinostat toxicity and response levels in individual patients. Vorinostat is not metabolized by and does not inhibit the cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme system, and only two drug interactions have been noted with vorinostat: warfarin and valproic acid or other HDAC inhibitors. In two Phase II studies, patients with CTCL treated with oral vorinostat demonstrated significant reductions in skin lesions and decreased disease progression. The overall response rate was approximately 30%, including one complete response and a time to response of approximately 10 weeks. At the approved 400-mg, once-daily dose, vorinostat was well tolerated, with the most common grade 1 or 2 adverse events being fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. More-severe toxicities included thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and nausea and occurred in less than 6% of patients.
Vorinostat, a novel HDAC inhibitor, is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with CTCL and is being investigated for its efficacy and safety in other types of cancers and as a part of combination therapy.
Recent evidence suggests that agmatine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, might be an important neurotransmitter in central nervous system and has potential as a treatment of pain. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of agmatine on allodynia in two experimental neuropathic pain models, the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model and the streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats, and to determine if the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors influence this effect of agmatine. Nerve injury was produced by tight ligation of the left L5 and L6 spinal nerves, and diabetic neuropathy is induced with the injection of a single dose of STZ; these procedures resulted in tactile allodynia in the hindpaw. Tactile allodynia was detected by application of von Frey filaments to the plantar surface of the foot. Agmatine reduced mechanical allodynia with its higher doses. Dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), a NMDA receptor antagonist, and the NOS inhibitors, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 7-nitroindazole, did not influence the antiallodynic effect of agmatine. These results suggest that agmatine has an antiallodynic effect in both spinal nerve ligation and diabetic models and may be a promising drug in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
Toxicosis was induced in pregnant heifers by feeding 25,000 mg/head/day of FireMaster BP-6, a commercial blend of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB). The PBB feeding decreased dry matter intake approximately 50% by 4 days exposure. Emaciated animals became anorexic a few days prior to death at 33 to 66 days. Weight losses of heifers average 80 kg. Other clinical signs observed were dehydration, diarrhea, excessive salivation and lacrimation, fetal death, abortion, and general depression as evidenced by depressed heart and respiratory rates. Clinical signs were apparent after 10 days exposure and progressively intensified along with loss of condition until death. Clinicopathologic changes included significantly increased serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and decreased serum calcium by 30 days exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase, urea nitrogen, and bilirubin were elevated, and serum albumin decreased by 36 to 40 days. Principal urine changes were decreased specific gravity and moderate proteinuria. Pregnant heifers fed 0.25 or 250 mg/head/day for 60 days and nonpregnant heifers fed 250 mg/head/day for 180 days displayed neither clinical signs nor clinicopathologic changes indicating adverse effects from PBB exposure. Post-exposure, all heifers exposed to PBB for 60 days calved normally with zero calf mortality and were successfully rebred. Milk production was not different from control animals. Birth weights of calves from dams exposed to 250 mg PBB/head/day were significantly greater than calves of dams exposed to 0 mg or 0.25 mg/head/day. PBB exposure of dams produced no detrimental effects on calves as indicated by clinical signs, clinicopathologic changes, or performance.
Absolute thresholds from 125 Hz to 52 kHz are determined for six guinea pigs trained by a positive reinforcement method. Four to five hundred trials were conducted during daily testing sessions and little between- or within-subject variability was found. Two of the six animals were subsequently treated with kanamycin and the development of a hearing loss for the high frequencies was followed. Loss of outer and to a lesser extent inner hair cells was well correlated with the threshold shift observed. Contrary to the experience of previous investigators, this operant training procedure has proved as efficient as that for other species of experimental animals, such as the monkey and the chinchilla. It holds excellent promise for future auditory behavioral work with the guinea pig.
A C57BL/6J mouse model was used to examine the coteratology of alcohol and cocaine. Plugged female mice were assigned to one of four treatment groups: control, cocaine only, alcohol only, or alcohol-cocaine. Experimental animals were treated from gestation day (GD) 6-18 and were killed the morning of GD 19. Alcohol was administered in a liquid diet containing 25% ethanol-derived calories (25% EDC), and cocaine was administered daily in subcutaneous injections of 60 mg/kg. All groups were pair-fed to the alcohol-cocaine group. The results showed that the cocaine-only and the alcohol-cocaine group had fewer successful pregnancies. The alcohol-only group had the lowest maternal weight gain from GD 1-19. There were no treatment group effects on litter size, sex ratio, or prenatal mortality. Importantly, fetuses in the alcohol-cocaine group weighed less than all other groups and had the greatest occurrence of fetal anomalies. These data confirm the teratogenic effects of alcohol and cocaine and suggest that the combination of the two drugs, if administered chronically, is more deleterious to pregnancy and fetal outcome than either drug alone.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by chronic hyperandrogenic anovulation and is associated with insulin resistance. Its pathogenesis is believed to be multifactorial, and abnormal gene regulation could be one contributing factor. Type 5 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD5) appears to be the major testosterone-forming 17beta-HSD isoenzyme in females.
Our objective was to investigate the role of a potentially activating 17beta-HSD5 gene (HSD17B5) variant in hyperandrogenism.
We conducted a case study and case-control cohort study in our General Clinical Research Center.
Subjects included a case of PCOS who had hyperthecosis associated with profound type B insulin resistance and an unusual, frankly male testosterone response to a GnRH agonist test, as well as 121 PCOS patients and 128 population controls.
Interventions were diagnostic.
Main outcome measures included sequencing of HSD17B5 5'-flanking region and nine exons, genotype/phenotype studies, and in vitro functional studies.
Our case had a previously undescribed homozygous HSD17B5 variant (G-to-A substitution) -71 bp in the promoter region. Genotyping controls showed this to be a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-71G. Luciferase activity of a SNP-71G promoter construct was significantly higher than that of the wild type, and EMSAs revealed that SNP-71G possessed significantly increased affinity to nuclear transcription factors. SNP-71G allele frequency (32.2 vs. 22.3%) and SNP-71G allele presence (53.7% vs. 38.3%) were significantly increased in PCOS (P = 0.01) [corrected] SNP-71G homozygosity tended to contribute about 20% to the plasma testosterone level.
SNP-71G is a functional polymorphism that may contribute to testosterone excess in a subset of PCOS patients.
Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common form of cancer and often has a poor prognosis. Establishment of effective therapies for lung cancer is a major concern in clinical cancer research. We compared the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, vinorelbine and cladribine, on a human lung cancer cell line, A549, and its derivative transfected with the DNase γ gene. We observed selective cytotoxicity of cladribine on the DNase γ-expressing sub-cell line of A549. Cladribine induces selective apoptosis in DNase γ-expressing A549 cells, which depends on activation of caspases. These results suggest that a combination therapy that includes cladribine along with the introduction of DNase γ has potential as a new therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.
Clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity to azathioprine may mimic symptoms of the initial disease. We report 5 cases of peculiar skin hypersensitivity reactions to azathioprine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
In 5 patients with a recent azathioprine regimen, manifestations appeared between 8 and 18 days after drug introduction. All patients had a high fever. Three patients initially had erythema nodosum; 2 patients had sterile pustules. All had elevated neutrophil counts and serum C-reactive protein levels, whereas eosinophil counts were normal, ruling out drug-induced rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. In 3 patients who were rechallenged with azathioprine or with 6-mercaptopurine, dermatological lesions recurred within hours.
Erythema nodosum and pustules are rarely reported manifestations of azathioprine hypersensitivity. Both skin lesions may be related to the clinical activity of inflammatory bowel disease. Relapse of such lesions shortly after thiopurine rechallenge should raise the hypothesis of hypersensitivity rather than pharmacological manifestations.
We restudied histologically and immunohistochemically 17 endometrial carcinomas, 2 malignant mixed tumors and 180 endometria with benign changes during or after tamoxifen therapy. The carcinomas were subtyped according to the 1994 WHO-classification. Endometrial biopsies were taken only if the endometrial thickness was > 8 mm sonographically, when a polyp was seen, or for postmenopausal bleeding. About half of the endometrial specimens showed simple or cystic atrophy, 55-76% had cystic-atrophic polyps or regressive hyperplasia. Depending upon the dose of tamoxifen, 7-19% (30 mg) to 27-36% (20 mg) showed moderate glandular proliferation. 20-33% had foci of mucinous, clear cell or serous-papillary metaplasia. 68-70% revealed diffuse extensive fibrosis of the endometrial stroma. None of 11 patients biopsied before starting tamoxifen therapy had advanced endometrial glandular proliferation in the second endometrial biopsy after tamoxifen treatment. None of the 19 endometrial neoplasms after tamoxifen therapy was of the endometrioid type: 11 were mucinous adenocarcinomas, 4 clear cell carcinomas, 2 serous-papillary carcinomas, one carcinosarcoma and one malignant Mullerian mixed tumor. The reasons for discrepancies between suspicious sonograms and endometrial atrophy are discussed.
Torsade de pointes is a polymorphic form of ventricular tachycardia associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which may be either congenital or acquired. Etiologies for the acquired forms include drug effects, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, starvation, sick sinus syndrome, and atrioventricular block. We present a 76-year-old man with acute on chronic renal failure, hypocalcemia, on ciprofloxacin, and a prolonged QT interval with torsade de pointes triggered by hemodialysis. The QT prolongation was corrected by treating the hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia and ciprofloxacin are known to independently cause prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes; our case illustrates that dialysis can trigger torsade on a background of this risk factor combination.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 96 weeks adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) treatment for chronic hepatitis patients with cirrhosis in their decompensation period.
Chronic hepatitis patients with cirrhosis in their decompensation period were randomly divided into two groups. An ADV group: patients treated with 10 mg ADV per day; a lamivudine (LMV) group: patients treated with 100mg LMV per day. The course of treatment lasted 96 weeks. Serum levels of ALT, AST, Alb, Tbil, HbeAg, HBV DNA, PCIII, IVC, LN and HA, renal function, Child-Pugh scores, drug adverse reactions and complication during the treatment of the two groups were analyzed.
During the two-year treatment, the proportions of patients with a return to normal liver function were similar in both groups. With the treatment prolonged, serum HBV DNA levels of the patients in adefovir dipivoxil group decreased gradually. The HBV DNA level in some lamivudine-treated patients was increased. The sero-conversion rate of HBeAg/HBeAb of the patients in the two groups was increased with the prolongation of the treatment. At 96 weeks, the ratio of emerging virus-resistant strains was lower in the adefovir dipivoxil group than in the lamivudine group. The levels of the serum markers of hepatic fibrosis of the patients in the two groups remained low. Child-Pugh scores of the patients in the two groups were significantly improved. No significant difference in the total incidence of complications between the two groups was noticed. Each of the two groups had a patient with liver-kidney syndrome and other serious complications.
The efficacy and safety of adefovir dipivoxil and lamivudine treatment for the above patients are similar, but the ratio of emerging virus-resistant strains of the adefovir dipivoxil treatment group is lower than that of lamivudine treatment group.
Growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling plays key roles in regulating growth of normal hepatocytes, however, which receptor-type tyrosine kinase (RTK) is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of these receptors in different stages of rat liver carcinogenesis. We compared the expression profile of RTK genes in rat normal liver and diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatoma tissues using a homology cloning method with degenerated primers. In situ hybridization, immunohistochemical staining, and RT-PCR were performed to analyze the cell type-specific expression of target RTKs during the chemically-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Sequence analysis of 459 clones identified 23 different RTK genes. The Tie-2, c-Met, and Flk-1 genes were the most abundant RTK genes cloned in rat hepatoma compared to normal liver. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies showed overexpression of c-Met and Flk-1 in GST-P positive preneoplastic lesions as well as neoplastic lesions. Tie-2 was expressed not only in endothelial cells but also in so-called oval cells, which are thought to be liver stem cells. Tie-2 ligand, angiopointin-1, mRNA was detected in both normal livers and hepatoma cells/tissues. In contrast, angiopoietin-2 mRNA was detected only in hepatoma tissues. These results indicate that c-Met, Tie-2 and Flk-1 signals play important roles in different stages of chemically-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Distinctive gene expression of RTK may contribute to epigenic implication of hepatoma formation.
Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) has been reported to be overexpressed in the development and progression of many tumor types. SRC-3 has been detected in several lung cancer cell lines, but its expression and clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. In this study, 48 NSCLC tissues were collected and tissue microarrays were performed. The expression of SRC-3 was examined using nickel-intensified IHC. The results showed that of these 48 cases, 18 (37.5%) exhibited high levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity, 23 (47.9%) exhibited moderate levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity, and 7 (14.6%) were negative; thus, the total frequency of SRC-3 overexpression was 85.4% (41/48). This SRC-3 overexpression frequency was similar to the overexpression frequency observed for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (82.1% vs 90%) and for metastasis and non-metastasis patients (84.6% vs 85.7%). Data analysis demonstrated a significantly higher overexpression frequency in male patients compared with that in female patients (88.6% vs 76.9%). However, female patients tended to have higher expression levels of SRC-3, as measured by immunoreactivity, than male patients. These results demonstrate a high frequency of SRC-3 overexpression in NSCLC with a gender difference, suggesting that there is a specific role for SRC-3 in the pathogenesis of NSCLC.
Susceptibility to lead toxicity is often assumed to be greatest during early childhood (e.g., 2 years of age), but recent studies suggest that blood lead concentrations (BPb) taken at 5-7 years of age are more strongly associated with IQ.
We aimed to determine the age of greatest susceptibility to lead exposure using an innovative statistical approach that avoids the problem of correlated serial BPb measurements.
We analyzed two cohorts of children that were followed from infancy to 6 years of age in Rochester, New York (n = 211), and Cincinnati, Ohio (n = 251). Serial BPb levels were measured and IQ tests were done when children were 6 years of age. After adjustment for relevant covariates, the ratio of 6-year BPb to 2-year BPb was added to the multiple regression model to test whether the pattern of BPb profiles during childhood had additional effect on IQ.
The ratio of BPb at 6 years to the BPb at 2 years showed a strong effect on IQ (p < .001) when added to the multiple regression model that included the average childhood BPb. IQ decreased by 7.0 points for children whose BPb at 6 years of age was 50% greater than that at 2 years compared with children whose 6-year BPb was 50% less than their 2-year BPb. Similarly, criminal arrest rates were a factor of 3.35 higher for those subjects whose 6-year BPb was 50% higher than their 2-year BPb.
We conclude that 6-year BPb is more strongly associated with cognitive and behavioral development than is BPb measured in early childhood.
Long-term exposure to urban air pollution may accelerate atherogenesis, but mechanisms are still unclear. The induction of a low-grade systemic inflammatory state is a plausible mechanistic pathway.
We analyzed the association of residential long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and high traffic with systemic inflammatory markers.
We used baseline data from the German Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study of 4,814 participants that started in 2000. Fine PM [aerodynamic diameter <or= 2.5 microm (PM(2.5))] exposure based on a small-scale dispersion and chemistry transport model was assigned to each home address. We calculated distances between residences and major roads. Long-term exposure to air pollution (annual PM(2.5) and distance to high traffic) and concentration of inflammatory markers [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen] on the day of the baseline visit were analyzed with sex-stratified multiple linear regression, controlling for individual-level risk factors.
In the adjusted analysis, a cross-sectional exposure difference of 3.91 microg/m(3) in PM(2.5) (interdecile range) was associated with increases in hs-CRP of 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.1 to 47.4%] and fibrinogen of 3.9% (95% CI, 0.3 to 7.7%) in men, whereas we found no association in women. Chronic traffic exposure was not associated with inflammatory markers. Short-term exposures to air pollutants and temperature did not influence the results markedly.
Our study indicates that long-term residential exposure to high levels of PM(2.5) is associated with systemic inflammatory markers in men. This might provide a link between air pollution and coronary atherosclerosis.
There is growing evidence that traffic-related air pollution reduces birth weight. Improving exposure assessment is a key issue to advance in this research area.
We investigated the effect of prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution via geographic information system (GIS) models on birth weight in 570 newborns from the INMA (Environment and Childhood) Sabadell cohort.
We estimated pregnancy and trimester-specific exposures to nitrogen dioxide and aromatic hydrocarbons [benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene, and o-xylene (BTEX)] by using temporally adjusted land-use regression (LUR) models. We built models for NO(2) and BTEX using four and three 1-week measurement campaigns, respectively, at 57 locations. We assessed the relationship between prenatal air pollution exposure and birth weight with linear regression models. We performed sensitivity analyses considering time spent at home and time spent in nonresidential outdoor environments during pregnancy.
In the overall cohort, neither NO(2) nor BTEX exposure was significantly associated with birth weight in any of the exposure periods. When considering only women who spent < 2 hr/day in nonresidential outdoor environments, the estimated reductions in birth weight associated with an interquartile range increase in BTEX exposure levels were 77 g [95% confidence interval (CI), 7-146 g] and 102 g (95% CI, 28-176 g) for exposures during the whole pregnancy and the second trimester, respectively. The effects of NO(2) exposure were less clear in this subset.
The association of BTEX with reduced birth weight underscores the negative role of vehicle exhaust pollutants in reproductive health. Time-activity patterns during pregnancy complement GIS-based models in exposure assessment.
Studies relying on outdoor pollutants measures have reported associations between air pollutants and birth weight.
Our aim was to assess the relation between maternal personal exposure to airborne benzene during pregnancy and fetal growth.
We recruited pregnant women in two French maternity hospitals in 2005-2006 as part of the EDEN mother-child cohort. A subsample of 271 nonsmoking women carried a diffusive air sampler for a week during the 27th gestational week, allowing assessment of benzene exposure. We estimated head circumference of the offspring by ultrasound measurements during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and at birth.
Median benzene exposure was 1.8 microg/m(3) (5th, 95th percentiles, 0.5, 7.5 microg/m(3)). Log-transformed benzene exposure was associated with a gestational age-adjusted decrease of 68 g in mean birth weight [95% confidence interval (CI), -135 to -1 g] and of 1.9 mm in mean head circumference at birth (95% CI, -3.8 to 0.0 mm). It was associated with an adjusted decrease of 1.9 mm in head circumference assessed during the third trimester (95% CI, -4.0 to 0.3 mm) and of 1.5 mm in head circumference assessed at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy (95% CI, -3.1 to 0 mm).
Our prospective study among pregnant women is one of the first to rely on personal monitoring of exposure; a limitation is that exposure was assessed during 1 week only. Maternal benzene exposure was associated with decreases in birth weight and head circumference during pregnancy and at birth. This association could be attributable to benzene and a mixture of associated traffic-related air pollutants.
Drugs frequently cause cutaneous adverse reactions. The suspected agent is sometimes difficult to identify, especially in patients receiving multidrug treatment and with underlying illnesses that may contribute to the clinical picture. In our patient, propranolol-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis was diagnosed by exclusion.
A 58-year-old man presented to the hospital with fever and headache after amoxicillin intake. Physical examination, laboratory, and a cranial CT scan were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. After discontinuation of amoxicillin and symptomatic care, the patient quickly improved. Interestingly, he had had two prior episodes of aseptic meningitis that were probably also related to the administration of amoxicillin. Aseptic meningitis can be caused by multiple non-infectious conditions including drugs, malignancy, and autoimmune diseases. We report a case associated with amoxicillin that meets the criteria of drug-induced aseptic meningitis. Considering the wide utilization of amoxicillin, healthcare providers should be aware of it as a possible cause of drug-induced aseptic meningitis.
The ability of the triazolobenzodiazepines to antagonize the anxiogenic effects of three different compounds in the social interaction test was investigated. The compounds were selected for their different sites of action in the central nervous system: FG 7142, acting at the beta-carboline site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex; pentylenetetrazole, acting at the picrotoxin site on this complex, and yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Adinazolam (5 mg/kg) and U-43,465 (32 mg/kg) were able to antagonize the anxiogenic effects of all three compounds, unlike classical 1,4-benzodiazepines, that are not able to antagonize the effects of yohimbine. The results are discussed in terms of the anti-panic activity of the triazolobenzodiazepines.
The influence of chronic pre- and postnatal naltrexone exposure on the sensitivity of offspring to the locomotor effects of morphine was investigated in C-57 Black mice. Pregnant mice were injected subcutaneously (sc) with either saline (0.1 ml/10 g) or naltrexone (10 mg/kg) twice daily during gestation and throughout lactation, 21 days postpartum. One, three and seven weeks after birth, male offspring were tested for locomotor activity. At 7 weeks of age, dose-response curves were obtained with morphine (10, 31.6, and 100 mg/kg) and amphetamine (0.31, 10 and 31.6 mg/kg) in naltrexone-pretreated and in saline-treated animals. Naltrexone exposure during gestation and lactation resulted in an augmented sensitivity of offspring to the locomotor activity-increasing effects of morphine. In these animals, the dose-response relationship for the effect of morphine on locomotor activity was displaced to the left about threefold. In contrast, naltrexone exposure did not alter the sensitivity of offspring to amphetamine. It was also found that offspring of naltrexone-treated animals have significantly greater spontaneous locomotor activity than that of the offspring of saline-treated mothers. The increased locomotor activity persisted for at least 4 weeks after the last injection of naltrexone. These findings indicate that chronic opioid receptor blockade during gestation and early postnatal development induces supersensitivity to the locomotor effects of morphine and is associated with long-lasting behavioral alterations.
Acute hypotension was observed during the spinal shock stage of a 35-year-old C3 complete tetraplegic patient after receiving nebulised terbutaline for respiratory therapy. Nine weeks later, when he had recovered from spinal shock, he again received nebulised terbutaline but there was no significant fall in arterial blood pressure. This case illustrates the possibility of a serious degree of hypotension occurring in such patients with this drug.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered to be the backbone of colorectal cancer (CRC) systemic therapy since the great majority of recommended regimens include its administration. A clinical picture consisting of chest pain, sometimes cardiac enzyme elevation, electrocardiogram abnormalities consistent with myocardial ischemia, and normal coronary angiogram associated with 5-FU administration have been infrequently reported. The clinical dilemma is: which chemotherapy regimen should we use in CRC patients with a previous acute coronary syndrome (ACS) associated with 5-FU?
We describe the case of a 55-year-old otherwise healthy woman with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma who presented an ACS probably secondary to arterial vasospasm while receiving continuous intravenous 5-FU infusion (mFOLFOX6 regimen). After the ACS, the patient was treated with raltitrexate plus oxaliplatin (TOMOX) and subsequently with irinotecan plus cetuximab with no other cardiac event.
The risk of cardiotoxicity associated with 5-FU is low but real. The probable mechanism is arterial vasospasm, as suggested by our case report. Both the use of the TOMOX regimen and irinotecan plus cetuximab seems to be safe regimens to be considered in this clinical scenario.
Although mutations in CYTB (cytochrome b) or BCS1L have been reported in isolated defects of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (cIII), most cIII-defective individuals remain genetically undefined. We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in the gene encoding tetratricopeptide 19 (TTC19) in individuals from two families affected by progressive encephalopathy associated with profound cIII deficiency and accumulation of cIII-specific assembly intermediates. We later found a second homozygous nonsense mutation in a fourth affected individual. We demonstrated that TTC19 is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of two high-molecular-weight complexes, one of which coincides with cIII. We then showed a physical interaction between TTC19 and cIII by coimmunoprecipitation. We also investigated a Drosophila melanogaster knockout model for TTC19 that showed low fertility, adult-onset locomotor impairment and bang sensitivity, associated with cIII deficiency. TTC19 is a putative cIII assembly factor whose disruption is associated with severe neurological abnormalities in humans and flies.
A total of 18 patients with locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder underwent 2 preoperative cycles of chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin followed by radical cystectomy and 2 postoperative cycles of chemotherapy. Radical cystectomy was performed in 17 of 18 patients (94%) with a pathological partial response in 3 (17%) and a pathological complete response in 2 (11%), for an over-all response rate of 28% (95% confidence limits 10 to 53%). At 23-month median followup 9 patients (50%) remained without evidence of recurrent disease, while 9 (50%) died of metastatic bladder cancer. Average relative dose intensity of all therapy given was 78%. Hematological toxicity was moderate, with no septic deaths or bleeding complications. However, 4 thromboembolic events occurred. While downstaging of the primary bladder tumor can occur with this perioperative schedule our results were not as impressive as some previously reported findings. The incidence of thromboembolic events is worrisome.
High-percent mammographic density adjusted for age and body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. We conducted a meta analysis of five genome-wide association studies of percent mammographic density and report an association with rs10995190 in ZNF365 (combined P = 9.6 × 10(-10)). Common variants in ZNF365 have also recently been associated with susceptibility to breast cancer.
Susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a complex inflammatory disease, is influenced by common variants at many loci. The common exonic synonymous SNP (c.313C>T) in IRGM, found in strong linkage disequilibrium with a deletion polymorphism, has been classified as non-causative because of the absence of an alteration in the IRGM protein sequence or splice sites. Here we show that a family of microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-196, is overexpressed in the inflammatory intestinal epithelia of individuals with Crohn's disease and downregulates the IRGM protective variant (c.313C) but not the risk-associated allele (c.313T). Subsequent loss of tight regulation of IRGM expression compromises control of intracellular replication of Crohn's disease-associated adherent invasive Escherichia coli by autophagy. These results suggest that the association of IRGM with Crohn's disease arises from a miRNA-based alteration in IRGM regulation that affects the efficacy of autophagy, thereby implicating a synonymous polymorphism as a likely causal variant.
