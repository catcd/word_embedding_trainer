This survey is part of a more comprehensive study on the health consequences of pesticide exposure. In the county (municipality) of Paty do Alferes, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, 55 agricultural workers were interviewed on the use of pesticides, use of personal protective equipment, data on health status, and symptoms related to pesticide exposure, disposal of agrochemical containers, and technical assistance. The most widely used pesticides were insecticides such as abamectin, organophosphate compounds, and pyrethroids, and fungicides such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and copper products. As a rule, pesticides are handled carelessly, and 92% of workers involved in the mixing, loading, and spraying of insecticides and fungicides used no protective clothing or equipment whatsoever. Some 62% of workers reported at least one illness associated with mixing or spraying pesticides. The most frequently reported symptoms were headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, skin irritation, and blurred vision, and 21% of affected workers required medical care. In more than half (51%) of the cases, workers reported using organophosphate insecticides from toxicological class I when they felt sick.
The multidrug resistance-associated proteins (Mrps) are a family of adenosine triphosphate-dependent transporters that facilitate the movement of various compounds, including bile acids, out of hepatocytes. The current study was conducted to determine whether induction of these transporters alters bile acid disposition as a means of hepatoprotection during bile acid-induced cholestasis. Lithocholic acid (LCA) was used to induce intrahepatic cholestasis. C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with corn oil (CO) or known transporter inducers, phenobarbital (PB), oltipraz (OPZ), or TCPOBOP (TC) for 3 days prior to cotreatment with LCA and inducer for 4 days. Histopathology revealed that PB and TC pretreatments provide a protective effect from LCA-induced toxicity, whereas OPZ pretreatment did not. Both PB/LCA and TC/LCA cotreatment groups also had significantly lower alanine aminotransferase values than the LCA-only group. In TC/LCA cotreated mice compared with LCA only, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of uptake transporters Ntcp and Oatp4 was significantly increased, as were sinusoidal efflux transporters Mrp3 and Mrp4. Although in PB/LCA cotreated mice, the only significant change compared with LCA-only treatment was an increase in uptake transporter Oatp4. Oatp1 was reduced in all groups compared with CO controls. No significant changes in mRNA expression were observed in Oatp2, Bsep, Mrp2, Bcrp, Mrp1, Mrp5, or Mrp6. Mrp4 protein expression was induced in the OPZ/LCA and TC/LCA cotreated groups, whereas Mrp3 protein levels remained unchanged between groups. Protein expression of Mrp1 and Mrp5 was increased in the unprotected LCA-only and OPZ/LCA mice. Thus, transporter expression did not correlate with histologic hepatoprotection, however, there was a correlation between hepatoprotection and significantly reduced total liver bile acids in the PB/LCA and TC/LCA cotreated mice compared with LCA only. In conclusion, changes in transporter expression did not correlate with hepatoprotection, and therefore, transport may not play a critical role in the observed hepatoprotection from LCA-induced cholestasis in the C57BL/6 mouse.
Hypertension is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and its complications, which are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Although recent clinical trials indicate that antihypertensive treatment reduces morbidity and mortality associated with stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal insufficiency, questions remain as to whether such treatment also prevents coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. The observed reduction in CHD mortality from pooled clinical trial data was 10-14% and was much less than the expected 20-25% reduction for a 5-6 mm Hg reduction in diastolic pressure. One explanation may be that subtle adverse metabolic effects of treatment may have blunted the beneficial effects. Isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, is a potent antihypertensive drug with antiatherogenic properties in animal models. Therefore, we hypothesized that isradipine may be appropriate for testing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in retarding the progression of atherosclerosis in humans. The Multicenter Isradipine/Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) is a clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy of isradipine (2.5 or 5 mg b.i.d.) with hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 or 25 mg b.i.d.) in retarding the progression of early carotid atherosclerosis as monitored by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography.
High indices of mortality in cattle have been reported in Brazil as a consequence of Palicourea marcgravii (Pm) acute intoxications. It has been established that Pm leaves contain monofluoroacetic acid (MFA), the active toxic principle of the plant. Rational therapy for MFA poisoning involves the use of a substance that might prevent fluorocitric acid formation. The present work was undertaken to verify if acetamide, a MFA antidote and an acetate donor, protects rats against both Pm and MFA intoxications. It was verified that acetamide protected rats from both convulsions and death. Future experiments should be carried out on cattle to examine the efficiency of acetamide, and particularly under field conditions.
The percentage of chemotherapy-induced necrosis in primary tumors corresponds with outcome in several childhood malignancies, including high-risk metastatic diseases. In this retrospective pilot study, the authors assessed the importance of postchemotherapy necrosis in high-risk neuroblastoma with a histological and case notes review of surgically resected specimens. The authors reviewed all available histology of 31 high-risk neuroblastoma cases treated with COJEC (dose intensive etoposide and vincristine with either cyclophosphamide, cisplatin or carboplatin) or OPEC/OJEC (etoposide, vincristine and cyclophosphamide with alternating cisplatin [OPEC] or carboplatin [OJEC]) induction chemotherapy in 2 Children's Cancer & Leukaemia Group (CCLG) pediatric oncology centers. The percentage of postchemotherapy necrosis was assessed and compared with MYCN amplification status and overall survival. The median percentage of postchemotherapy tumor necrosis was 60%. MYCN status was available for 28 cases, of which 12 were amplified (43%). Survival in cases with ≥ 60% necrosis or ≥ 90% necrosis was not better than those with less necrosis, nor was percentage necrosis associated with survival using Cox regression. However, MYCN-amplified tumors showed a higher percentage of necrosis than non-MYCN-amplified tumors, 71.3% versus 37.2% (P = .006). This effect was not related to prechemotherapy necrosis and did not confer improved overall survival. Postchemotherapy tumor necrosis is higher in patients with MYCN amplification. In this study, postchemotherapy necrosis did not correlate with overall survival and should not lead to modification of postoperative treatment. However, these findings need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study of children with high-risk neuroblastoma.
Circulating antibodies reacting specifically with the cell membrane of hepatocytes isolated from halothane-anesthetized rabbits were detected in nine of 11 patients with fulminant hepatic failure after helothane-induced anesthesia. The immunoglobulin deposition, as revealed by immunofluorescence, showed a granular pattern on the hepatocyte surface membrane. Preincubation of halothane-pretreated, but not of control, hepatocytes with serum containing this antibody rendered them susceptible to cytotoxic effects of normal lymphocytes in vitro. Control studies using serum from subjects repeatedly exposed to halothane without the development of liver damage, and from patients with viral and toxic liver injury have confirmed the specificity of these findings to serve halothane-associated liver injury. These results provide further evidence of an immunologic component in this condition.
Improved therapies are needed for nonsmall cell lung cancer. Diazeniumdiolate-based nitric oxide (NO)-releasing prodrugs are a growing class of promising NO-based therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (JS-K, 1) is effective against nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in culture and in vivo. Here we report mechanistic studies with compound 1 and its homopiperazine analogue and structural modification of these into more stable prodrugs. Compound 1 and its homopiperazine analogue were potent cytotoxic agents against NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo, concomitant with activation of the SAPK/JNK stress pathway and upregulation of its downstream effector ATF3. Apoptosis followed these events. An aryl-substituted analogue, despite extended half-life in the presence of glutathione, did not activate JNK or have antitumor activity. The data suggest that rate of reactivity with glutathione and activation of JNK/ATF3 are determinants of cancer cell killing by these prodrugs.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent regularly utilized in anesthesia. There are numerous adverse effects of succinylcholine ranging from mild to fatal; one such effect is succinylcholine myalgia. We report the case of a 34-year-old woman who received succinylcholine while undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and later developed succinylcholine myalgia leading to a prolonged hospital stay and subsequent pneumonia. In the presence of suitable alternative paralytic agents, succinylcholine should be avoided in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The use of a designated anesthesia team familiar with bariatric operations can help maximize peri-operative management and minimize complications.
Oxytetracycline given to two patients with impaired renal function produced clinical deterioration and increasing azotaemia. Both patients improved when oxytetracycline was stopped. In general tetracycline should not be used in patients with poor renal function, but if it is necessary the blood urea level should be checked frequently.
Vinorelbine (Navelbine), a new vinca alkaloid, is an effective drug in breast cancer. Our study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerance of Navelbine in refractory advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer (AMBC).
One hundred heavily pretreated patients with AMBC entered the study and were scheduled to receive 30 mg/m2 of Navelbine weekly by a 20 min i.v. infusion with dose adjustments according to tolerance. All patients had previously received at least one chemotherapy regimen including an anthracycline for advanced disease.
Sixteen of the 100 assessable patients responded (1 complete response and 15 partial responses), for an overall response rate of 16% (IC 95: 8%-23%). The median duration of response was 5 months (3-18). Responses were seen in lymph nodes (13/27), breast (11/34), soft tissue and skin (13/36), lung (3/14) and liver (2/25), but not in bone metastases. The main toxicities (WHO grade > or = 3) were granulocytopenia and anemia in, respectively, 51% and 9% of all 100 eligible patients. Thrombocytopenia and other non-haematological toxicities consisting of peripheral neuropathy, constipation, nausea/vomiting, alopecia and phlebitis were rare and mild.
Vinorelbine is an active drug in AMBC, particularly in breast, lymph nodes and skin/soft tissue sites, with an excellent tolerance. Since the mean dose intensity was 19.7 mg/m2/week, a dose of 20 mg/m2/week is recommended for heavily pretreated patients (radiotherapy and chemotherapy).
Stroke is the third most common cause of death in developed countries. In England and Wales, 1000 people under the age of 30 have a stroke each year. Cocaine is the most commonly used class A drug, and the first report of cocaine-induced stroke was in 1977. Since the development of alkaloidal "crack" cocaine in the 1980s, there has been a significant rise in the number of case reports describing both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke associated with cocaine use. Cocaine is a potent central nervous system stimulant, and acts by binding to specific receptors at pre-synaptic sites preventing the reuptake of neurotransmitters. The exact mechanism of cocaine-induced stroke remains unclear and there are likely to be a number of factors involved including vasospasm, cerebral vasculitis, enhanced platelet aggregation, cardioembolism, and hypertensive surges associated with altered cerebral autoregulation. The evidence surrounding each of these factors will be considered here.
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which is in most cases of unknown etiology. Mutations of the Park-2 gene are the most frequent cause of familial parkinsonism and parkin knockout (PK-KO) mice have abnormalities that resemble the clinical syndrome. We investigated the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, treating midbrain neuronal cultures from PK-KO and wild-type (WT) mice with rotenone (ROT). ROT (0.025-0.1 microm) produced a dose-dependent selective reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells and of other neurons, as shown by the immunoreactivity to microtubule-associated protein 2 in PK-KO cultures, suggesting that the toxic effect of ROT involved dopamine and other types of neurons. Neuronal death was mainly apoptotic and suppressible by the caspase inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Boc-D-FMK). PK-KO cultures were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by low doses of ROT than those from WT. ROT increased the proportion of astroglia and microglia more in PK-KO than in WT cultures. Indomethacin, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, worsened the effects of ROT on tyrosine hydroxylase cells, apoptosis and astroglial (glial fibrillary acidic protein) cells. N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, increased ROT-induced apoptosis but did not change tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive or glial fibrillary acidic protein area. Neither indomethacin nor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester had any effect on the reduction by ROT of the mitochondrial potential as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Microglial NADPH oxidase inhibition, however, protected against ROT. The roles of p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways were tested by treatment with SB20358 and PD98059, respectively. These compounds were inactive in ROT-naive cultures but PD98059 slightly increased cellular necrosis, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels, caused by ROT, without changing mitochondrial activity. SB20358 increased the mitochondrial failure and lactate dehydrogenase elevation induced by ROT. Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia, prevented the dropout of tyrosine hydroxylase and apoptosis by ROT; the addition of microglia from PK-KO to WT neuronal cultures increased the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to ROT. PK-KO mice were more susceptible than WT to ROT and the combined effects of Park-2 suppression and ROT reproduced the cellular events observed in Parkinson's disease. These events were prevented by minocycline.
Amitriptyline intoxication can result in severe ventricular arrhythmias that may be refractory to medical management. The mechanisms of these arrhythmias are unclear, and their optimal management is problematic. We studied the cardiac effects of amitriptyline infusion in anesthetized and awake dogs. Amitriptyline significantly increased heart rate, QRS duration, and AH and HV intervals. The concentration-response curves for these effects were, however, quite different, with significant changes beginning at a concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.4 mg/L for heart rate, compared with 2.4 +/- 0.4 mg/L for QRS and HV intervals and 3.7 +/- 0.5 mg/L for the AH interval. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias developed after marked QRS widening had occurred, and appeared in all six awake dogs and five of the six anesthetized dogs studied. Sodium bicarbonate was given to seven animals with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and it rapidly reversed the arrhythmia in all instances. The benefit from sodium bicarbonate could not be attributed to changes in serum potassium or amitriptyline concentrations. It may have been due to alkalinization or changes in serum sodium concentration. These experiments suggest that: (a) amitriptyline intoxication frequently produces ventricular tachyarrhythmias, if high enough drug concentrations are achieved; (b) these arrhythmias are associated with marked slowing of intraventricular conduction; and (c) sodium bicarbonate is effective therapy for amitriptyline-induced ventricular arrhythmia.
A total of 1,068 patients, aged 18-70 yrs, with mild to moderate reversible airways disease, were recruited into a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study in 76 European centres. Following a 2 week run-in period, the 692 patients fulfilling the entry criteria were randomized to 4 weeks treatment with either salmeterol 12.5, 50 or 100 micrograms or placebo b.d. all given by pressurized inhaler, with assessments of symptoms and ventilatory lung function prior to dosing. All three doses of salmeterol had significant efficacy, manifested by increased morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (by 35-59 l.min-1 and 11-38 l.min-1, respectively), by reduced diurnal variation in PEFR, and by reduced requirement for additional bronchodilator for symptomatic relief. These effects were dose-related. Daytime asthma symptoms and nocturnal awakenings were significantly reduced by salmeterol treatment, although these reductions were not dose-related. The incidence of adverse events was low. Pharmacologically predictable events (e.g. tremor) were more frequent after treatment with 100 micrograms b.d. than with placebo. On the basis of the efficacy and side-effect information, 50 micrograms b.d. is considered to be the optimum dose for the treatment of this group of asthmatics.
A recent publication from the HORIZON (Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence With Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly) trial in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis reported a higher risk of serious atrial fibrillation (AF) in zoledronic acid recipients than in placebo recipients. This adverse effect was unexpected and had not been recognized previously.
We studied alendronate sodium ever use in relation to the risk of incident AF in women in a clinical practice setting. This population-based case-control study was conducted at Group Health, an integrated health care delivery system in Washington State. We identified 719 women with confirmed incident AF between October 1, 2001, and December 31, 2004, and 966 female control subjects without AF, selected at random from the Group Health enrollment and frequency matched on age, presence or absence of treated hypertension, and calendar year.
More AF case patients than controls had ever used alendronate (6.5% [n = 47] vs 4.1% [n = 40]; P = .03). Compared with never use of any bisphosphonate, ever use of alendronate was associated with a higher risk of incident AF (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.15) after adjustment for the matching variables, a diagnosis of osteoporosis, and a history of cardiovascular disease. Based on the population-attributable fraction, we estimated that 3% of incident AF in this population might be explained by alendronate use.
Ever use of alendronate was associated with an increased risk of incident AF in clinical practice.
Propofol is associated with abnormal motor events resembling seizures, the exact nature of these events remains to be elucidated. We describe here a case of seizure-like activity after propofol-induced conscious sedation accompanied by a prolactin rise, together suggesting that the event was ictal.
Several brominated chemicals have been shown to be multisite-multispecies carcinogens in laboratory animals, and in this paper we report that the flame retardant, 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (BMP) is also a multisite carcinogen in both sexes of Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. BMP was administered continuously in the diet for up to 2 yr to rats at doses of 0, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm and to mice at doses of 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm. Interim groups of rats were examined at 15 mo. An additional recovery group of male rats received the chemical for 3 mo at 20,000 ppm in the feed, and then the control diet for the remainder of the study. Chemical exposure caused neoplasms of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, mammary gland, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity, esophagus, forestomach, small intestine, large intestine, mesothelium, kidney, urinary bladder, lung, thyroid gland, seminal vesicle, hematopoietic system, and pancreas in the male rat; mammary gland, oral cavity, esophagus, and thyroid gland in the female rat; lung, kidney, and Harderian gland in male mice; and subcutaneous tissue, lung, and Harderian gland in the female mouse. The recovery group of male rats presented with the same spectrum of treatment-related neoplasms as in the core study. In this recovery group, BMP (at 20,000 ppm) caused irreversible effects at numerous sites after 90 days of exposure that was not detectable by histologic examination, but without further exposure resulted in carcinogenic responses at 2 yr. BMP is mutagenic in the salmonella test, but it was not determined if the BMP-induced effects that eventually lead to development of neoplasms at multiple sites are the same in both species and in all organ systems affected.
Endocrine and reproductive alterations are frequently reported to occur in women with temporal lobe epilepsy as well as in female rats in different experimental models of limbic seizures. As previously reported, women with epilepsy have lower fertility rates than women without epilepsy (Tanganelli, P., Regesta, G., 1992. Neurology (suppl.) 42 (5), 89-93; Cummings, L.N., Guidice, L., Morrel, M.J., 1995. Epilepsia 36, 355-359). In order to investigate the possible substrate of endocrine alterations in epilepsy, hormonal and gestational parameters were studied in female rats submitted to the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. The results demonstrated that the oestrus cycle is altered following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and such alteration lasted for several weeks. Progesterone, LH and FSH levels decreased and estradiol levels increased significantly during the period of spontaneous and recurrent seizures. The frequency of seizures during pregnancy and lactation decreased. These results document that significant changes in gonadal, hypophyseal and hypothalamic hormones, as well as in sexual behaviour, occur following status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine administration.
Familial male precocious puberty (FMPP) is a gonadotropin-independent disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant, male-limited pattern. Affected males generally exhibit signs of puberty by age 4. Testosterone production and Leydig cell hyperplasia occur in the context of prepubertal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). The LH receptor is a member of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, and we hypothesized that FMPP might be due to a mutant receptor that is activated in the presence of little or no agonist. A single A-->G base change that results in substitution of glycine for aspartate at position 578 in the sixth transmembrane helix of the LH receptor was found in affected individuals from eight different families. Linkage of the mutation to FMPP was supported by restriction-digest analysis. COS-7 cells expressing the mutant LH receptor exhibited markedly increased cyclic AMP production in the absence of agonist, suggesting that autonomous Leydig cell activity in FMPP is caused by a constitutively activated LH receptor.
A patient with penicillin-induced immune hemolytic anemia had massive intravascular hemolysis with hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria. Substantial amounts of complement components C3 and C4 were detected on the patient's red blood cells (RBCs), in addition to the usual IgG antibody to penicillin. The patient's serum demonstrated a high titer of antibody to penicillin (8,000), which did not cause hemolysis in vitro, but did cause complement fixation when incubated with normal serum. The presence of complement components on the patient's RBCs, and the finding that the serum fixed complement in vitro suggests that penicillin-antipenicillin immune complexes may have been present in the serum. We attribute the severity of the hemolysis to participation of the complement system in the hemolytic process and to the high titer of antibody to pencillin.
We recently reported the anticarcinogenic potential of hexaammine cobalt(III) chloride, a synthetic complex of cobalt, on diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-induced carcinogenesis. The present study was conducted to ascertain the possible mode of action of this compound on DENA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in male BALB/c mice. Time course evaluation of liver injury markers showed that the low dose of the compound is more effective in ameliorating DENA-induced changes when administered for longer duration of time. Long-term exposure of the compound significantly reversed the levels of diacylgylcerol (DAG) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) induced by DENA, thus suggesting that the compound may hinder the process of chemical carcinogenesis potentially by downregulating the signal transduction mechanism involving DAG and NOS. Furthermore, short-term intraperitoneal injection of the compound to mice 26 weeks after DENA initiation reduced the cell viability count in preneoplstic liver lesions in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results showed that anticarcinogenic effects of hexaammine cobalt(III) chloride result from its influence on signal transduction events mediated through DAG together with its direct cytotoxic action against preneoplastic hepatic lesions induced by DENA in mice.
1-Adamantanamine (amantadine) pretreatment significantly reduced the motor hyperactivity and hyperthermia caused by d-amphetamine in reserpinized mice. In drug-naive mice, when amantadine was administered after d-amphetamine, the motor activity caused by the latter also was decreased. Since our earlier studies showed that amantadine pretreatment also antagonized the increases in both motor activity and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the caudate nucleus caused by d-amphetamine in mice, it is suggested that the antagonism is due to a competitive blockade at the pre-synaptic level in the brain.
Oxidative stress due to iron deposition in hepatocytes or Kupffer cells contributes to the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury. The aim of this study was to clarify the association between dietary iron and liver injuries in rats. Liver injury was initiated by the administration of thioacetamide or ligation of the common bile duct in rats fed a control diet (CD) or iron-deficient diet (ID). In the acute liver injury model induced by thioacetamide, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, as well as hepatic levels of lipid peroxide and 4-hydroxynonenal, were significantly decreased in the ID group. The expression of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling positivity showed a similar tendency. The expression of interleukin-1beta and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA was suppressed in the ID group. In liver fibrosis induced by an 8-wk thioacetamide administration, ID suppressed collagen deposition and smooth muscle alpha-actin expression. The expressions of collagen 1A2, transforming growth factor beta, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta mRNA were all significantly decreased in the ID group. Liver fibrosis was additionally suppressed in the bile-duct ligation model by ID. In culture experiments, deferoxamine attenuated the activation process of rat hepatic stellate cells, a dominant producer of collagen in the liver. In conclusion, reduced dietary iron is considered to be beneficial in improving acute and chronic liver injuries by reducing oxidative stress. The results obtained in this study support the clinical usefulness of an iron-reduced diet for the improvement of liver disorders induced by chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
The renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor Study 84 [SIOP MMT 84]) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment. Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide (six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin [IVA]). None of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy. Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years; 58 patients were males and 42 females. The most common primary tumor site was the head and neck. Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes, glucosuria, proteinuria, aminoaciduria, urinary pH, osmolarity, creatinine clearance, phosphate tubular reabsorption, beta 2 microglobulinuria, and lysozymuria. Fifty-eight patients (78%) had normal renal tests, whereas 16 patients (22%) had renal abnormalities. Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major toxicity resulting in Fanconi's syndrome (TDFS); and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption. The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria. Severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide, a younger age (less than 2 1/2 years old), and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement. This low percentage (5%) of TDFS must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children.
In order to investigate the effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) used in hypotensive anesthesia on the adrenal endocrine function, aldosterone, corticosterone (Comp B) and cAMP production were measured in isolated glomerulosa (G-c) and fasciculata cells (F-c) of the rats. Rat glomerulosa and fasciculata cells were obtained by enzymatic digestion of the adrenals of male wistar rats. The cell pellet was suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA and distributed in 900 microliters aliquots to polyethylene tubes. The samples were preincubated for 90 min in a 37 degrees C water bath aerated with 5% CO2/95% O2. PGE1 or ACTH 50 microliters was added and incubated for 4 hr. Total volume of the incubation medium is 1.0 ml. Aldosterone and cAMP were measured by radioimmunoassay and Comp B was determined by fluorimetric method. PGE1 increased significantly the basal secretion of aldosterone and Comp B in G-c and F-c, respectively. The steroidogenic effect of PGE1 was dose dependent in aldosterone production. This aldosterone production was also accompanied with cAMP production. On the other hand, significant increase of cAMP was not observed in comp B production. These results suggest that cAMP may be the second messenger in PGE1-induced aldosterone production in G-c. But PGE1 receptors in F-c seem not to be coupled to the adenylate cyclase system. The addition of ACTH and PGE1 resulted in inhibition of aldosterone secretion when compared with that obtained by ACTH alone. Several researchers have shown that low doses of PGE1 depressed the basal aldosterone secretion. These findings may be contributing to Na-uresis effect during PGE1-induced hypotension.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interactive toxicity of ethanol with potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7-chromium). Young, male Wistar rats (100-120 g) were divided into four groups of five or six animals each and were dosed, through water, with 10% ethanol (vol./vol.) or 25 ppm chromium or were dosed with a combination of ethanol+chromium at the same concentrations for a period of 22 weeks ad libitum and were maintained on normal diet. Control animals were maintained on a normal diet and water for the same period. The serum succinate dehydrogenase and liver total triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in the three treated groups. The serum alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly reduced in ethanol-treated rats, and there was no significant change in the acid phosphatase activity. Serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels in the three treated groups were significantly increased. The liver glycogen significantly decreased in both the ethanol-treated and the chromium-treated rats. There was a significant increase in liver total cholesterol levels in chromium-treated rats. Total glutathione levels were significantly decreased in the livers of ethanol-treated and ethanol+chromium-treated rats. To further substantiate these findings, a histological examination of the liver and kidneys was undertaken. The livers of alcohol-treated animals showed altered hepatic architecture in the centrilobular and periportal areas, with increased sinusoidal space (space of Disse), vacuolation, and necrosis of hepatocytes. Similar changes were observed in a histological examination of the livers of chromium-treated rats, except that the damage to the hepatocytes was more confined to the periportal area. Moreover, histological examination of the livers of ethanol+chromium-treated rats revealed uniform damage in the centrilobular and periportal areas, as was observed in the groups treated either with ethanol or chromium. The histological examination of the kidneys in the three treated groups revealed significant damage to the renal tubules and Bowman's capsule, which showed vacuolation and degeneration of the basement membrane. These findings correlate well with the serum enzyme levels found in the treated groups. It is evident from this study that chronic ethanol consumption sensitizes the liver to the toxic action of agents such as chromium. It leads to impairment of the biochemical functions in the liver, and it causes liver and kidney damage. Long-term simultaneous exposure to ethanol and chromium may cause severe health problems in people who are alcoholics and work in chrome-plating and leather-tanning industries.
